# Portfolio-page

I have made a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The HTML file has the name index.html and has two corresponding CSS Files style.css and style2.css and a javascript file of name script.js.

I have applied bootstrap to make the cards and website a bit responsive and javascript to add animations on my webpage.

I learned basics of bootstrap in last few days and applied them here.
